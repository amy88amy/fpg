### FPG

**F**raud **P**rediction using **G**raph features. 

#### Dataset

1. We have used a dataset available on Kaggle - [Synthetic data from a Financial payment system](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/banksim1).
2. All the raw data is copied to [data](https://github.com/PratikBarhate/fpg/tree/master/data) directory.

#### Software dependencies

1. Python - v3.6
2. To install the required packages run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` depending on your system configuration.

#### Step required to execute code

1. To execute the jupyter notebooks go into the notebooks directory - `cd code/notebooks`, and start the jupyter notebook on your system. From the jupyter notebook's web UI you can start any of the notebooks.

2. To execute the self paced sampling example - `cd code/sampling` and execute command `python3 using_self_paced.py`.
